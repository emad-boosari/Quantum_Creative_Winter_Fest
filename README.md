# Quantum_Creative_Winter_Fest

## Introduction
In this project, I am going to give a simple idea for shuffling cards for any game like *Poker*, *Black Jack* or high and low. In a card game, there is a preprocessing step for shuffling the cards which are normally performed by the dealer. I had always complained about the shuffling process and some dealers try to cheat during that. As you maybe know there is some technique for cheating in the card shuffling process. In the following project, I present a quantum circuit to generate a list of cards for playing. which is completely random and independent of the dealer's shuffling skill.

## Quantum Card Shuffling
Normally a deck of cards is 52 cards. Thus a system with 6 qubits can provide 64 basis states which is a little bit more than what we needed.
