# Quantum_Creative_Winter_Fest

## Introduction
In this project, I am going to give a simple idea for shuffling cards for any game like *Poker*, *Black Jack* or high and low. In a cards game, there is a preprocessing step for shuffling the cards which normally perform by dealer. I am alwyas had complained about the shuffling process and some dealers try to cheat during that. As you maybe know there are some technique for cheating in card shuffling process. In the following project I present a quantum circuit to generate a list of cards for playing. which is completely random and independent of dealer's shuffling skill.
